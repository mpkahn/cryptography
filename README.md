  # Description
  
  Cryptography is a React app that allows users to have a one-stop-shop to keep up with the quickly-evolving world of cryptocurrency! This app allows for users to input and update your current coin holdings, as well as multiple API's that allow you to see the current coin market prices and data to help you make informed decisions. A news feed at the top provides the latest Crypto headlines to let you know what's going on right "now" in the world of crypto.
